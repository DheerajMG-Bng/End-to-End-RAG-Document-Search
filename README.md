# End-to-End RAG-Based Document Search
---

## Project Overview

This ongoing project explores the design and evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, starting from a traditional RAG pipeline and extending it into a document-centric, agentic search system.

The work focuses on retrieval quality, document ingestion, vector indexing, and controlled answer generation, with an emphasis on modularity, reproducibility, and real-world applicability.

#### Currently 
Working on to develop an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, evolving from traditional RAG pipelines to an agentic document search framework using LangChain, LangGraph, and vector databases.
